# counter

A vue js application where I implemented a counter composable with increment, decrement, reset, setValue functions. I practiced state management using vuex. Also, I housed my functionalities in a page with route - ‘/counter’. Any other route would redirect the user to a 404 page handled by a wildcard route.
