        <h1>About Counter</h1>
        <p>A counter is a device which stores (and sometimes displays) the number of times a particular event or process has occurred, 
            often in relationship to a clock.
             Counters are generally classified as either synchronous or asynchronous. 
             In synchronous counters, all flip-flops share a common clock and change state at the same time. 
             In asynchronous counters, each flip-flop has a unique clock, and the flip-flop states change at different times.</p>
